## Introduction

The workshop will focus on new and improved methods, techniques, and applications of Computer Vision for Modern Vehicles. A previous issue of this workshop has been held at Wuhan, China (2017). This third issue is being held with [ACPR2019](https://www.acpr2019.org) at Auckland, New Zealand.  
The aim of this workshop is to bring together engineers and scientists from academia, industry and government to exchange results and ideas for future applications of Computer Vision for Modern Vehicles.

Computer vision for modern vehicles gave researchers access to camera technologies for wide-ranging applications in the automotive industry. Computer vision-based driver assistance is an emerging technology, in both the automotive industry and academia. Despite the existence of some commercial safety systems such as night vision, adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning systems, we are at the beginning of a long research pathway towards a future generation of intelligent vehicles.

## Call for Papers

**Call for papers**: We welcome submissions on the following topics, including but not limited to:

*	Low-level vision and image processing, image/video denoising, image enhancement, image super-resolution
*	Stereo vision: 3D computer vision, stereo matching
*	Semantic segmentation, grouping and shape representation
*	Recognition: detection, categorization, indexing and matching, motion and tracking
*	Deep Learning, statistical methods and learning
*	Video: events, activities and surveillance (e.g. at road intersections)
*	Automated vehicles with and without pilot/driver, partial vehicle automation
*	Driver monitoring, driver human factors and personalization
*	Sensing, detection, and actuation
*	Advanced vehicle safety systems, lane change and merging
*	Vision and environment perception, vision based ADAS
*	Vehicle localization and autonomous navigation
